# SOLUTIO-Team-Shaji-Paapan
Arduino Simulation Portfolio for the IEEE RFID Society 'SOLUTIO' Competition. A collection of 5 automated systems ranging from basic sensor logic to complex emergency response simulations.

# SOLUTIO: Arduino Simulation Challenge
**IEEE RFID Society Problem-Solving Portfolio**

This repository contains five automated solutions designed for the SOLUTIO competition. Each project focuses on hardware logic and C++ programming within the Tinkercad simulation environment.

##  Project Portfolio

### 1. Automatic Street Light
Automates urban lighting using an **LDR** and threshold-based logic to conserve energy during daylight hours.

### 2. Smart Dustbin
A touchless hygiene solution utilizing an **Ultrasonic Sensor** and **Servo Motor** to automate waste disposal.

### 3. Vehicle Parking Counter System
A smart infrastructure project that tracks occupancy.
* **Hardware:** 2x PIR Sensors, I2C LCD, LEDs.
* **Logic:** Increments/decrements available spaces based on motion detection at entry and exit gates.

### 4. Smart Irrigation System
Precision agriculture system that monitors soil health.
* **Hardware:** Soil Moisture Sensor, Relay, DC Pump, I2C LCD.
* **Logic:** Automatically triggers the water pump when moisture levels fall below the set threshold.

### 5. Accident Detection & Emergency Alert System
A high-level safety system using an **Accelerometer** to detect vehicle impacts, featuring a user-override safety countdown and simulated GSM/GPS emergency alerts.
